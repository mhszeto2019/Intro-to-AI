## ASSIGNMENT 1 
#### Question 3
###### Construct a small Bayesian network in the pgmpy toolbox. This network models the relationship between yellow fingers, smoking, cancer, weakness, radiation, solar flares, and using a microwave

##### Question 4
###### Create an artificial neural based classifier to classify the fashion_mnist dataset which is available at https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets. More details about this dataset are here: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.

##### Question 5
###### Explore transfer learning in the context of CNNs. More hints to solve this question are at: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning <br>
###### Use a pre-trained network (MobileNetV2) to do image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset (more on the dataset here https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). We have provided you a code skeleton (skeletonCode.ipynb) to help you finish this problem. You are free to change this file as required.
